# Task 2 – Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)  

---

## ​ Project Overview  
This repository presents **Task 3** of my CodeAlpha internship: transforming raw data into clear and impactful visual formats—charts, graphs, and dashboards—using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. The goal was to enhance data understanding and craft compelling visual stories to support decision-making.

---

##  Key Objectives  
- Translate raw datasets into insightful visualizations (line charts, bar plots, heatmaps, etc.)  
- Use **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to build intuitive and aesthetically pleasing visuals  
- Focus on clarity and narrative—each chart tells a story and offers actionable insights  
- Curate a strong portfolio of visualizations demonstrating structured design and analytical depth

---
**Outcomes:**
Spotlighted key trends and patterns hidden in the data

Delivered visual narratives that enhance comprehension and inform strategic decisions

Enhanced my skills in visual storytelling and data design

**Libraries used:**
Matplotlib – foundational plotting library in Python 


Seaborn – high-level visualization built on Matplotlib for statistical graphics 


Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration and storytelling
